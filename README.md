# Miscellaneous Notes

These are short notes that I think are useful to share but will not become articles. 
- **Du, R.S.**, 2023. *Learning the Evolution of Statistical Moments and Extreme Values from Data*. [[pdf]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Empyreal092/Misc_Notes_Public/main/Learning_Change_in_Moments/Learning_Change_in_Moments.pdf)	
	- This note presents an easy way to diagnose the change in statistical moments and extremes from time-series data. It is simple to implement and versatile. We think it is most useful as a tool to quickly explore the time evolution of interesting quantities in data. 
- **Du, R.S.**, 2023. *Plotting and Fitting Power-Laws*. [[pdf]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Empyreal092/Misc_Notes_Public/main/Plot_Fit_Power_Law/Plot_Fit_Power_Law.pdf)	
	- Data following power-laws are ubiquitous in applied fields. In this note, we examine how one should diagnose the power-law exponent from data and how one should plot these data. One of our conclusion is that: linear regression on the log-log form of the data is not always appropriate.
